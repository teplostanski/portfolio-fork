Moonbloom Theme is a cohesive color scheme designed to transform your development workspace. Imagine customizing all your tools (Visual Studio Code editor, terminals like Alacritty or iTerm2, zsh shell, and other applications) with a unified, eye-pleasing color palette inspired by the serene atmosphere of nighttime.

The core mission of this project is to reduce eye strain during long coding sessions by creating a comfortable and cozy programming environment. Just as moonlight gently illuminates the night landscape, this theme provides a balanced color combination that helps you stay focused on your work without unnecessary eye fatigue.
